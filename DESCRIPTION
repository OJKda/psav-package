Description: We conducted a study on a regression spline estimator with a few prespecified auxiliary variables. For the implementation of the proposed estimators,we adapted a coordinate descent algorithm. This was implemented by considering a structure of the sum of the residuals squared objective function determined by the B-spline and the auxiliary coefficients. We also considered an efficient stepwise knot selection algorithm based on the Bayesian information criterion.
