* abstract

  We conducted a study on a regression spline estimator with a few prespecified auxiliary variables. For the implementation of the proposed estimators, we adapted a coordinate descent algorithm. This was implemented by considering a structure of the sum of the residuals squared objective function determined by the B-spline and the auxiliary coefficients. We also considered an efficient stepwise knot selection algorithm based on the Bayesian information criterion. This was to adaptively select smoothly functioning estimator data. Numerical studies using both simulated and real datasets were conducted to illustrate the proposed method's performance.  An R software package psav is available.
